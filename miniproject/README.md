## Assumptions made:
1. This is a program outside a movie theatre, and not an online movie booking system (like BookMyShow).
2. The user knows what movies are being played and will directly use this program to book their preferred movie.
3. The user will only need to book tickets for one movie, hence the program has a lifetime of just one cycle. 
4. There is only one kind of seat option and user cannot choose where they want to sit.
