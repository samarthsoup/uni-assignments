# MOVIE BOOKING SYSTEM
### A simple code for a movie booking system using CSV files for storing and accessing data. The backend file can be used by the theatre staff to add, delete movies as well as check what movies are available in the current rotation. The ui file is to be used by the user to book tickets.<br /> 
<br />

## Assumptions made:
1. This is a program outside a movie theatre, and not an online movie booking system (like BookMyShow).
2. The user knows what movies are being played and will directly use this program to book their preferred movie.
3. The user will only need to book tickets for one movie, hence the program has a lifetime of just one cycle. 
4. There is only one kind of seat option and user cannot choose where they want to sit.
5. Only same day booking is available, tickets cannot be booked for future dates.
